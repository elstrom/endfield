Starting now, my workflow is:

Place Debug Logs at Every Step: Before implementing complex logic or fixing a bug, I will ensure there are debugLog or console.log statements at the beginning, critical decision points, and end of the relevant functions/blocks.
Use Logs as the Source of Truth: I will rely on the actual terminal/console output to verify execution flow and variable states, rather than assuming the code works as read.
Trace Until "Goal Print": I will follow the logs until I see the confirmation message (Goal Print) that the intended action has successfully completed.
I have noted this requirement in my persistent memory for this session.

(Since we are currently troubleshooting and refining the system, I will proceed with this mindset for any further debugging or feature implementation.)
