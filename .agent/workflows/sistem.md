# AIC Factory Mechanics Analysis

Notes based on the Game8 guide for Arknights: Endfield.

## 1. Core Structures
- **PAC (Protocol Automation-Core)**: The heart of the main base. Generates power and serves as a primary teleport point.
- **Sub-PAC**: Central building for outposts. Functions similarly to PAC but located in remote areas to expand factory footprint.
- **Outposts**: Used to unlock more factory space by progressing the story and using Stock Bills. Outposts can have Operators assigned as Liasons to provide bonuses.
- **Shared Storage**: The Depot (storage) of all Sub-PACs and the main PAC are **shared within each region**, making logistics across a region easier.

## 2. Power Management
- **Thermal Banks**: The primary source of electricity. They require **Batteries** to operate.
- **Battery Tiers**: The type of battery fed into the Thermal Bank determines the power output. Higher tier batteries provide significantly more power.
- **Electricity Distribution**: Power only reaches machines within the coverage area of a PAC/Sub-PAC. To reach remote areas (like mining nodes), **Electric Relay Towers** must be placed sequentially.

## 3. Production & Economics
- **Automated Production Lines**: Involves connecting belts between facilities (Refining Units, Fitting Units, etc.).
- **Mining Nodes**: Must be powered to extract resources. Resources are automatically sent to AIC storage.
- **Regional Development**: Increasing development metrics improves node purity and yield.
- **Stock Bills**: Used to expand factory space. Can be farmed via Outpost Orders or "Stock Redistribution" (Stock Market).

## 4. Special Facilities
- **Combat Facilities**: Healing or damaging structures used in **Incursions** (Tower Defense mode).
- **Exploration Tools**: Ziplines and Beam Towers that help access high or remote areas.
- **Mechanized Planting**: Automating the growth of common plants for crafting consumables.
